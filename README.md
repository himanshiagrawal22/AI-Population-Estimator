# 🌍 AI Population Estimator

An AI-powered application that estimates the population of Indian cities using **NASA VIIRS Night-Time Light satellite imagery**, **Google Earth Engine**, **Random Forest Regression**, and **Streamlit**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Traditional population surveys and censuses are expensive, time-consuming, and conducted only once every few years. This project explores an alternative approach by using satellite-derived night-light intensity to estimate city populations through Machine Learning.

The model learns the relationship between **night-time light intensity** and **known population data**, enabling population prediction for cities where only satellite imagery is available.
